ICOS Intelligence Coordination
----------------------------------------
The ICOS Coordination API has two goals:
a) First, models can be pre-built and added to the API as specified in a Developer guide. The API outputs model predictions or information about a new model trained in this scenario. This is performed for easy integration of ML models with automated functions of the OS developed in ICOS.
b) Second, part of this API is targeted to extend ML libraries to make them available to a technical user to save storage resources in devices with access to the API. In this context, the API returns a framework environment to allow users easy plug-and-play with the environment already available in the API.
